# CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship 
# Task 1
A stock price prediction project is an excellent starting point. Itinvolves using historical stock market datasets, volatility indices, andfundamental indicators to forecast prices over the coming months. It'sa valuable introduction to working with large datasets and predictionmodeling. Begin by downloading a stock market dataset from sourceslike Quantopian or Quandl to kickstart the project.
 
## project steps:

1. Import the Data	
2. Data PreProcessing 
3. Stock Analysis (EDA)
   - using Visulaization Charts
   - Annualized_Volatility
   - correlation matrix
4. Apply Linear Regression Model
   - Model Selection and Training
   - Visualize the predictions
   - Evaluate the model's performance
